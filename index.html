        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Caleb Brown. I am a Political Science major at the University of Oregon, originally from Dallas, Texas. I plan to graduate in the Fall of 2026 and pursue law school afterward. My long-term goal is to work in sports representation with a strong legal foundation or enter the field of contract law. I bring a high level of adaptability, especially when navigating unfamiliar or fast-paced situations, along with strong teamwork and collaboration skills that help me thrive in group environments. These strengths continue to guide my professional growth and aspirations.

        <!-- Experience 1 -->
        <div class="experience">
            <h3>L.A.B. Golf – Putter Assembly Technician</h3>
            <img src="images/Unknown.jpeg" alt="Experience 1 Image" style="width:100%; aspect-ratio: 1 / 1; object-fit: contain; background:#000; border-radius:6px;">
            <p>
                I worked as a putter assembly technician for L.A.B. Golf from June 2025 to September 2025, one of the fastest growing golf equipment manufacturers in the world. I collaborated with a team to assemble intricate and highly technical putters in a process requiring both precision and efficiency. During my first week on the job, one of the company’s sponsor athletes won The Open, causing a sudden 2.5× increase in orders. This required me to learn the assembly process quickly and adapt to the high-demand environment. Additionally, I strengthened my networking skills through interactions with leadership and individuals such as owner Sam Hahn, helping me build connections that may benefit my future career.

            <h3>Bent Tree Country Club – Outside Services</h3>
            <img src="images/IMG_1583.jpg" alt="Experience 2 Image" style="width:100%; max-height:400px; object-fit: contain; background:#000; border-radius:6px;">
            <p>
                While working at Bent Tree Country Club, I gained valuable experience in customer relations. My role focused on ensuring members had everything they needed before their round, from maintaining the range to cleaning golf clubs. Working at a private course allowed me to interact closely with high-profile members, improving my ability to build relationships and understand customer expectations. The networking opportunities were significant—one coworker received a major job connection through a member, and I personally benefited when a former supervisor helped me connect with L.A.B. Golf, ultimately leading to an interview for a highly competitive position.

        <!-- Experience 3 -->

            <h3>University of Oregon – Political Science Studies</h3>
            <img src="images/IMG_0020.jpeg" alt="Experience 3 Image" style="width:100%; max-height:400px; object-fit: contain; background:#000; border-radius:6px;">
            <p>
                Studying Political Science at the University of Oregon has helped me strengthen my collaboration and professional communication skills. Many group projects required navigating sensitive or complex topics, coordinating meetings outside of class, and working with diverse peers toward shared goals. I also improved my communication abilities through regular interactions with professors, whether for feedback, clarification, or academic planning. These experiences have helped shape my ability to work effectively with others and maintain professionalism in various environments.
